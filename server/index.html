      <h3><a href= "/archie/2012/05/02/7-steps-toward-group-evaluation">7. Steps toward group evaluation <small>Adding interest to the POIs</small></a></h3>
      <p>The work so far has been to get to a point, without committing serious time to programming, at which a proper formative evaluation could be done, in the field, with a group of users. It would be best that users could be given a task to accomplish (walk to a particular location, for example) and then left to it, and that there should be some interest in using the app <em>per se</em>; so the next task would be to structure the set of POIs, and add media to the app, so that the walk, or some part of it, would actually be made more interesting.</p>

<p>The Scottish historical resource <a href='http://www.scran.ac.uk/'>SCRAN</a> presented a vast repository of images of Glasgow and the surrounding regions, free for academic use. In the interest of keeping an evaluative walk relatively short, and in placing as much interesting information in the app as possible, I concentrated on the remains of mills lining the River Kelvin on the first stretch of the walk.</p>

<p>Image and text attachments could now be added to the relevant POIs, becoming available when a curious user clicked on a POI icon in the display.</p>

<p>With a little tweaking, the webservice will be ready for an initial group evaluation.</p>

      <h3><a href= "/archie/2012/05/02/6-adding-thumbnails">6. Adding thumbnails <small>Beginning to distinguish the POIs</small></a></h3>
      <p>The first advantage of using an ARML-fed webservice over the Wikitude.me community service is the facility to assign thumbnails individually to POIs. This would be the first step in addressing the issue of pathfinding using the map and cam interfaces.</p>

<p>The first issue was to somehow inform the user about the <em>order</em> of the waypoints on the walk. Numbering the POIs seemed the sensible way to do this; numbering the POI names had worked very basically, but the names were not immediately visible in the map interface.</p>

<p>It also seemed apparent that not all POIs were in fact waypoints, so fields were added to the POI model to indicate the <em>type</em> of the POI and its <em>waypoint number</em> (which could be null).</p>

<p>The icons were designed to give simple indications of these two pieces of information.</p>

<p><img alt='Icons in the Wikitude interface' src='/assets/images/IMG_0252.PNG' /></p>

<p>Labels on the icons were still not terribly useful. They tended to get cut off before they had really said anything, so they were shortened to absolute bare-bones, giving the user an indication of the object they should be looking for, but relying on the longer POI description for fuller information.</p>

<p><img alt='Shorter icon names in use' src='/assets/images/IMG_0268.PNG' /></p>

<p>There were still issues with the placement of POIs in the display &#8211; the map display seemed accurate, but in the cam display there was a distinct bias to the north, and apparent issues with altitude (POIs appearing in the sky, for instance &#8230;).</p>
