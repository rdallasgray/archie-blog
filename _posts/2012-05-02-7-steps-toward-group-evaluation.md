The work so far has been to get to a point, without committing serious time to programming, at which a proper formative evaluation could be done, in the field, with a group of users. It would be best that users could be given a task to accomplish (walk to a particular location, for example) and then left to it, and that there should be some interest in using the app *per se*; so the next task would be to structure the set of POIs, and add media to the app, so that the walk, or some part of it, would actually be made more interesting.

The Scottish historical resource [SCRAN](http://www.scran.ac.uk/) presented a vast repository of images of Glasgow and the surrounding regions, free for academic use. In the interest of keeping an evaluative walk relatively short, and in placing as much interesting information in the app as possible, I concentrated on the remains of mills lining the River Kelvin on the first stretch of the walk.

Image and text attachments could now be added to the relevant POIs, becoming available when a curious user clicked on a POI icon in the display.

With a little tweaking, the webservice will be ready for an initial group evaluation.
