After extensive trawling of [SCRAN](http://www.scran.ac.uk/) and [RCAHMS](rcahms.gov.uk/), as well as a good bit of squinting at Google Earth and cros-referencing with sites like [Hidden Glasgow](http://www.hiddenglasgow.com/) and [Urban Glasgow] (http://urbanglasgow.co.uk/), I felt I had enough material that the Wikitude World could add real interest to the walk.

We're having beautiful weather in Glasgow at the moment, so it wasn't too hard to persuade a couple of friends to help out. Both are reasonably experienced walkers, and both have some interest in local history.

![Formative Evaluation]({{ BASE_PATH }}/assets/images/IMG_7160.jpg)

The first major problem we hit was battery consumption. The camera view, in particular, seems to hit the battery hard: we noted almost 20% consumption after only a half-hour or so of the walk (planned to take about 5 hours). There were also issues with the underlying Wikitude World Browser app. 

I created a questionnaire a couple of days after the walk, but informal chat and notes will probably be equally valuable. To summarise:

1. **High battery consumption**, especially in the camera view, means that app use probably has to be quite limited on a longer walk. 

2. **The compass is still not especially stable** -- there seemed to be a surprising variance between the two iPhone 4s in use, with one quite accurate and the other not. Switching between map and camera views seemed to 'reset' the compass, which helped a little.

3. This 'resetting' was also a problem, as **switching back from camera to map view reset the map view** also -- so if the user was zoomed in on a particular area, he had to find that area and zoom back in again after using the camera view.

4. **The map view in general was much more useful**; the camera view didn't help with wayfinding, didn't particularly help to locate views or sites of interest, and seemed to use a lot of battery power. Use of the camera view needs to be completely reconsidered.

5. Both **users tended to consult the app when they were curious about a landmark**, rather than use the app to identify sites of interest. In some cases the app didn't have information on what they were curious about -- which was disappointing.

6. There were **too many waypoints**, and sometimes directions weren't clear enough. There was in general not a clear enough distinction between the purposes of waypoints, views and sites of interest. Waypoints should be solely for wayfinding, and should have greater importance in the interface than views etc. Users need guidance when there's a choice of direction, and need to be able to ignore optional stops like views if they want to. One of the users quite liked having a stretch where he didn't feel he had to refer to the phone.

7. Both users preferred an **informal approach** to using the app -- they didn't really want to have different roles (e.g. one wayfinding, one highlighting points of interest).

8. **Compass points aren't the best way to indicate direction**. Reference to landmarks and use of left and right are clearer.

9. Both users were **looking ahead one or two waypoints** -- this is something that could be facilitated in the UI.

10. The most recent update to Wikitude World Browser seems to be stricter about which points in a World are visible: further away ones are supposed to appear as the user approaches them. Unfortunately this didn't happen, and **the app 'stuck' on the points that were visible at the start of the walk**, causing considerable confusion. The app had to be restarted before the missing points appeared.

11. **The walk wasn't really appropriate to the aapplication** -- the route I'd been set by my original advisor was problematic. Wayfinding was very tricky in places and certain parts of the walk weren't navigable (e.g. a very busy and narrow road without a pavement). The two fort sites weren't accessible (being behind barbed wire), so the usefulness of the camera view here couldn't really be tested.

Overall, the evaluation has prompted something of a rethink: the final app should use a map view to lead users to some localised site where the camera view can be used for a short time to do something more fit to its purpose than simply mark POIs. One suggestion was to try overlaying historical photographs on the camera scene, which I want to investigate the practicality of next.

I'll shortly give detail on the responses to the questionnaire, but the next post will cover some developments to the Wikitude platform.
